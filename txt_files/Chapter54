I
stared
at
Rhys
He
stared
at
me
His
cheeks
were
tinged
pink
with
cold
his
dark
hair
ruffled
and
he
honestly
looked
freezing
as
he
stood
there
wings
tucked
in
tight
And
I
knew
that
one
word
from
me
and
he’d
go
flying
off
into
the
crisp
night
That
if
I
shut
the
door
he’d
go
and
not
push
it
His
nostrils
flared
scenting
the
paint
behind
me
but
he
didn’t
break
his
stare
Waiting
Mate
My
mate
This
beautiful
strong
selfless
male
Who
had
sacrificed
and
wrecked
himself
for
his
family
his
people
and
didn’t
feel
it
was
enough
that
he
wasn’t
enough
for
anyone
Azriel
thought
he
didn’t
deserve
someone
like
Mor
And
I
wondered
if
Rhys
if
he
somehow
felt
the
same
about
me
I
stepped
aside
holding
the
door
open
for
him
I
could
have
sworn
I
felt
a
pulse
of
knee
wobbling
relief
through
the
bond
But
Rhys
took
in
the
painting
I’d
done
gobbling
down
the
bright
colors
that
now
made
the
cottage
come
alive
and
said
You
painted
us
I
hope
you
don’t
mind
He
studied
the
threshold
to
the
bedroom
hallway
Azriel
Mor
Amren
and
Cassian
he
said
marking
the
eyes
I’d
painted
You
do
know
that
one
of
them
is
going
to
paint
a
moustache
under
the
eyes
of
whoever
pisses
them
off
that
day
I
clamped
my
lips
to
keep
the
smile
in
Oh
Mor
already
promised
to
do
that
And
what
about
my
eyes
I
swallowed
All
right
then
No
dancing
around
it
My
heart
was
pounding
so
wildly
I
knew
he
could
hear
it
I
was
afraid
to
paint
them
Rhys
faced
me
fully
Why
No
more
games
no
more
banter
At
first
because
I
was
so
mad
at
you
for
not
telling
me
Then
because
I
was
worried
I’d
like
them
too
much
and
find
that
you
didn’t
feel
the
same
Then
because
I
was
scared
that
if
I
painted
them
I’d
start
wishing
you
were
here
so
much
that
I’d
just
stare
at
them
all
day
And
it
seemed
like
a
pathetic
way
to
spend
my
time
A
twitch
of
his
lips
Indeed
I
glanced
at
the
shut
door
You
flew
here
He
nodded
Mor
wouldn’t
tell
me
where
you’d
gone
and
there
are
only
so
many
places
that
are
as
secure
as
this
one
Since
I
didn’t
want
our
Hybern
friends
tracking
me
to
you
I
had
to
do
it
the
old
fashioned
way
It
took
a
while
You’re
better
Healed
completely
Quickly
considering
the
bloodbane
Thanks
to
you
I
avoided
his
stare
turning
for
the
kitchen
You
must
be
hungry
I’ll
heat
something
up
Rhys
straightened
You’d
make
me
food
Heat
I
said
I
can’t
cook
It
didn’t
seem
to
make
a
difference
But
whatever
it
was
the
act
of
offering
him
food
I
dumped
some
cold
soup
into
a
pan
and
lit
the
burner
I
don’t
know
the
rules
I
said
my
back
to
him
So
you
need
to
explain
them
to
me
He
lingered
in
the
center
of
the
cabin
watching
my
every
move
He
said
hoarsely
It’s
an
important
moment
when
a
female
offers
her
mate
food
It
goes
back
to
whatever
beasts
we
were
a
long
long
time
ago
But
it
still
matters
The
first
time
matters
Some
mated
pairs
will
make
an
occasion
of
it
throwing
a
party
just
so
the
female
can
formally
offer
her
mate
food
That’s
usually
done
amongst
the
wealthy
But
it
means
that
the
female
accepts
the
bond
I
stared
into
the
soup
Tell
me
the
story
tell
me
everything
He
understood
my
offer
tell
me
while
I
cooked
and
I’d
decide
at
the
end
whether
or
not
to
offer
him
that
food
A
chair
scraped
against
the
wood
floor
as
he
sat
at
the
table
For
a
moment
there
was
only
silence
interrupted
by
the
clack
of
my
spoon
against
the
pot
Then
Rhys
said
I
was
captured
during
the
War
By
Amarantha’s
army
I
paused
my
stirring
my
gut
twisting
Cassian
and
Azriel
were
in
different
legions
so
they
had
no
idea
that
my
forces
and
I
had
been
taken
prisoner
And
that
Amarantha’s
captains
held
us
for
weeks
torturing
and
slaughtering
my
warriors
They
put
ash
bolts
through
my
wings
and
they
had
those
same
chains
from
the
other
night
to
keep
me
down
Those
chains
are
one
of
Hybern’s
greatest
assets
stone
delved
from
deep
in
their
land
capable
of
nullifying
a
High
Fae’s
powers
Even
mine
So
they
chained
me
up
between
two
trees
beating
me
when
they
felt
like
it
trying
to
get
me
to
tell
them
where
the
Night
Court
forces
were
using
my
warriors
their
deaths
and
pain
to
break
me
Only
I
didn’t
break
he
said
roughly
and
they
were
too
dumb
to
know
that
I
was
an
Illyrian
and
all
they
had
to
do
to
get
me
to
yield
would
have
been
to
try
to
cut
off
my
wings
And
maybe
it
was
luck
but
they
never
did
And
Amarantha
She
didn’t
care
that
I
was
there
I
was
yet
another
High
Lord’s
son
and
Jurian
had
just
slaughtered
her
sister
All
she
cared
about
was
getting
to
him
killing
him
She
had
no
idea
that
every
second
every
breath
I
plotted
her
death
I
was
willing
to
make
it
my
last
stand
to
kill
her
at
any
cost
even
if
it
meant
shredding
my
wings
to
break
free
I’d
watched
the
guards
and
learned
her
schedule
so
I
knew
where
she’d
be
I
set
a
day
and
a
time
And
I
was
ready
I
was
so
damned
ready
to
make
an
end
of
it
and
wait
for
Cassian
and
Azriel
and
Mor
on
the
other
side
There
was
nothing
but
my
rage
and
my
relief
that
my
friends
weren’t
there
But
the
day
before
I
was
to
kill
Amarantha
to
make
my
final
stand
and
meet
my
end
she
and
Jurian
faced
each
other
on
the
battlefield
He
paused
swallowing
I
was
chained
in
the
mud
forced
to
watch
as
they
battled
To
watch
as
Jurian
took
my
killing
blow
Only
she
slaughtered
him
I
watched
her
rip
out
his
eye
then
rip
off
his
finger
and
when
he
was
prone
I
watched
her
drag
him
back
to
the
camp
Then
I
listened
to
her
slowly
over
days
and
days
tear
him
apart
His
screaming
was
endless
She
was
so
focused
on
torturing
him
that
she
didn’t
detect
my
father’s
arrival
In
the
panic
she
killed
Jurian
rather
than
see
him
liberated
and
fled
So
my
father
rescued
me
and
told
his
men
told
Azriel
to
leave
the
ash
spikes
in
my
wings
as
punishment
for
getting
caught
I
was
so
injured
that
the
healers
informed
me
if
I
tried
to
fight
before
my
wings
healed
I’d
never
fly
again
So
I
was
forced
to
return
home
to
recover
while
the
final
battles
were
waged
They
made
the
Treaty
and
the
wall
was
built
We’d
long
ago
freed
our
slaves
in
the
Night
Court
We
didn’t
trust
the
humans
to
keep
our
secrets
not
when
they
bred
so
quickly
and
frequently
that
my
forefathers
couldn’t
hold
all
their
minds
at
once
But
our
world
was
changed
nonetheless
We
were
all
changed
by
the
War
Cassian
and
Azriel
came
back
different
I
came
back
different
We
came
here
to
this
cabin
I
was
still
so
injured
that
they
carried
me
here
between
them
We
were
here
when
the
messages
arrived
about
the
final
terms
of
the
Treaty
They
stayed
with
me
when
I
roared
at
the
stars
that
Amarantha
for
all
she
had
done
for
every
crime
committed
would
go
unpunished
That
the
King
of
Hybern
would
go
unpunished
Too
much
killing
had
occurred
on
either
side
for
everyone
to
be
brought
to
justice
they
said
Even
my
father
gave
me
an
order
to
let
it
go
to
build
toward
a
future
of
co
existence
But
I
never
forgave
what
Amarantha
had
done
to
my
warriors
And
I
never
forgot
it
either
Tamlin’s
father
he
was
her
friend
And
when
my
father
slaughtered
him
I
was
so
damn
smug
that
perhaps
she’d
feel
an
inkling
of
what
I’d
felt
when
she
murdered
my
soldiers
My
hands
were
shaking
as
I
stirred
the
soup
I’d
never
known
never
thought
When
Amarantha
returned
to
these
shores
centuries
later
I
still
wanted
to
kill
her
The
worst
part
was
she
didn’t
even
know
who
I
was
Didn’t
even
remember
that
I
was
the
High
Lord’s
son
that
she’d
held
captive
To
her
I
was
merely
the
son
of
the
man
who
had
killed
her
friend
I
was
just
the
High
Lord
of
the
Night
Court
The
other
High
Lords
were
convinced
she
wanted
peace
and
trade
Only
Tamlin
mistrusted
her
I
hated
him
but
he’d
known
Amarantha
personally
and
if
he
didn’t
trust
her
I
knew
she
hadn’t
changed
So
I
planned
to
kill
her
I
told
no
one
Not
even
Amren
I’d
let
Amarantha
think
I
was
interested
in
trade
in
alliance
I
decided
I’d
go
to
the
party
thrown
Under
the
Mountain
for
all
the
courts
to
celebrate
our
trade
agreement
with
Hybern
And
when
she
was
drunk
I’d
slip
into
her
mind
make
her
reveal
every
lie
and
crime
she’d
committed
and
then
I’d
turn
her
brain
to
liquid
before
anyone
could
react
I
was
prepared
to
go
to
war
for
it
I
turned
leaning
against
the
counter
Rhys
was
looking
at
his
hands
as
if
the
story
were
a
book
he
could
read
between
them
But
she
thought
faster
acted
faster
She
had
been
trained
against
my
particular
skill
set
and
had
extensive
mental
shields
I
was
so
busy
working
to
tunnel
through
them
that
I
didn’t
think
about
the
drink
in
my
hand
I
hadn’t
wanted
Cassian
or
Azriel
or
anyone
else
there
that
night
to
witness
what
I
was
to
do
so
no
one
bothered
to
sniff
my
drink
And
as
I
felt
my
powers
being
ripped
away
by
that
spell
she’d
put
on
it
at
the
toast
I
flung
them
out
one
last
time
wiping
Velaris
the
wards
all
that
was
good
from
the
minds
of
the
Court
of
Nightmares
the
only
ones
I’d
allowed
to
come
with
me
I
threw
the
shield
around
Velaris
binding
it
to
my
friends
so
that
they
had
to
remain
or
risk
that
protection
collapsing
and
used
the
last
dregs
to
tell
them
mind
to
mind
what
was
happening
and
to
stay
away
Within
a
few
seconds
my
power
belonged
wholly
to
Amarantha
His
eyes
lifted
to
mine
Haunted
bleak
She
slaughtered
half
the
Court
of
Nightmares
right
then
and
there
To
prove
to
me
that
she
could
As
vengeance
for
Tamlin’s
father
And
I
knew
I
knew
in
that
moment
there
was
nothing
I
wouldn’t
do
to
keep
her
from
looking
at
my
court
again
From
looking
too
long
at
who
I
was
and
what
I
loved
So
I
told
myself
that
it
was
a
new
war
a
different
sort
of
battle
And
that
night
when
she
kept
turning
her
attention
to
me
I
knew
what
she
wanted
I
knew
it
wasn’t
about
sleeping
with
me
so
much
as
it
was
about
getting
revenge
at
my
father’s
ghost
But
if
that
was
what
she
wanted
then
that
was
what
she
would
get
I
made
her
beg
and
scream
and
used
my
lingering
powers
to
make
it
so
good
for
her
that
she
wanted
more
Craved
more
I
gripped
the
counter
to
keep
from
sliding
to
the
ground
Then
she
cursed
Tamlin
And
my
other
great
enemy
became
the
one
loophole
that
might
free
us
all
Every
night
that
I
spent
with
Amarantha
I
knew
that
she
was
half
wondering
if
I’d
try
to
kill
her
I
couldn’t
use
my
powers
to
harm
her
and
she
had
shielded
herself
against
physical
attacks
But
for
fifty
years
whenever
I
was
inside
her
I’d
think
about
killing
her
She
had
no
idea
None
Because
I
was
so
good
at
my
job
that
she
thought
I
enjoyed
it
too
So
she
began
to
trust
me
more
than
the
others
Especially
when
I
proved
what
I
could
do
to
her
enemies
But
I
was
glad
to
do
it
I
hated
myself
but
I
was
glad
to
do
it
After
a
decade
I
stopped
expecting
to
see
my
friends
or
my
people
again
I
forgot
what
their
faces
looked
like
And
I
stopped
hoping
Silver
gleamed
in
his
eyes
and
he
blinked
it
away
Three
years
ago
he
said
quietly
I
began
to
have
these
dreams
At
first
they
were
glimpses
as
if
I
were
staring
through
someone
else’s
eyes
A
crackling
hearth
in
a
dark
home
A
bale
of
hay
in
a
barn
A
warren
of
rabbits
The
images
were
foggy
like
looking
through
cloudy
glass
They
were
brief
a
flash
here
and
there
every
few
months
I
thought
nothing
of
them
until
one
of
the
images
was
of
a
hand
This
beautiful
human
hand
Holding
a
brush
Painting
flowers
on
a
table
My
heart
stopped
beating
And
that
time
I
pushed
a
thought
back
Of
the
night
sky
of
the
image
that
brought
me
joy
when
I
needed
it
most
Open
night
sky
stars
and
the
moon
I
didn’t
know
if
it
was
received
but
I
tried
anyway
I
wasn’t
sure
I
was
breathing
Those
dreams
the
flashes
of
that
person
that
woman
I
treasured
them
They
were
a
reminder
that
there
was
some
peace
out
there
in
the
world
some
light
That
there
was
a
place
and
a
person
who
had
enough
safety
to
paint
flowers
on
a
table
They
went
on
for
years
until
a
year
ago
I
was
sleeping
next
to
Amarantha
and
I
jolted
awake
from
this
dream
this
dream
that
was
clearer
and
brighter
like
that
fog
had
been
wiped
away
She
you
were
dreaming
I
was
in
your
dream
watching
as
you
had
a
nightmare
about
some
woman
slitting
your
throat
while
you
were
chased
by
the
Bogge
I
couldn’t
reach
you
speak
to
you
But
you
were
seeing
our
kind
And
I
realized
that
the
fog
had
probably
been
the
wall
and
that
you
you
were
now
in
Prythian
I
saw
you
through
your
dreams
and
I
hoarded
the
images
sorting
through
them
over
and
over
again
trying
to
place
where
you
were
who
you
were
But
you
had
such
horrible
nightmares
and
the
creatures
belonged
to
all
courts
I’d
wake
up
with
your
scent
in
my
nose
and
it
would
haunt
me
all
day
every
step
But
then
one
night
you
dreamed
of
standing
amongst
green
hills
seeing
unlit
bonfires
for
Calanmai
There
was
such
silence
in
my
head
I
knew
there
was
only
one
celebration
that
large
I
knew
those
hills
and
I
knew
you’d
probably
be
there
So
I
told
Amarantha
Rhys
swallowed
I
told
her
that
I
wanted
to
go
to
the
Spring
Court
for
the
celebration
to
spy
on
Tamlin
and
see
if
anyone
showed
up
wishing
to
conspire
with
him
We
were
so
close
to
the
deadline
for
the
curse
that
she
was
paranoid
restless
She
told
me
to
bring
back
traitors
I
promised
her
I
would
His
eyes
lifted
to
mine
again
I
got
there
and
I
could
smell
you
So
I
tracked
that
scent
and
And
there
you
were
Human
utterly
human
and
being
dragged
away
by
those
piece
of
crap
picts
who
wanted
to
He
shook
his
head
I
debated
slaughtering
them
then
and
there
but
then
they
shoved
you
and
I
just
moved
I
started
speaking
without
knowing
what
I
was
saying
only
that
you
were
there
and
I
was
touching
you
and
He
loosed
a
shuddering
breath
There
you
are
I’ve
been
looking
for
you
His
first
words
to
me
not
a
lie
at
all
not
a
threat
to
keep
those
faeries
away
Thank
you
for
finding
her
for
me
I
had
the
vague
feeling
of
the
world
slipping
out
from
under
my
feet
like
sand
washing
away
from
the
shore
You
looked
at
me
Rhys
said
and
I
knew
you
had
no
idea
who
I
was
That
I
might
have
seen
your
dreams
but
you
hadn’t
seen
mine
And
you
were
just
human
You
were
so
young
and
breakable
and
had
no
interest
in
me
whatsoever
and
I
knew
that
if
I
stayed
too
long
someone
would
see
and
report
back
and
she’d
find
you
So
I
started
walking
away
thinking
you’d
be
glad
to
get
rid
of
me
But
then
you
called
after
me
like
you
couldn’t
let
go
of
me
just
yet
whether
you
knew
it
or
not
And
I
knew
I
knew
we
were
on
dangerous
ground
somehow
I
knew
that
I
could
never
speak
to
you
or
see
you
or
think
of
you
again
I
didn’t
want
to
know
why
you
were
in
Prythian
I
didn’t
even
want
to
know
your
name
Because
seeing
you
in
my
dreams
had
been
one
thing
but
in
person
Right
then
deep
down
I
think
I
knew
what
you
were
And
I
didn’t
let
myself
admit
it
because
if
there
was
the
slightest
chance
that
you
were
my
mate
They
would
have
done
such
unspeakable
things
to
you
Feyre
So
I
let
you
walk
away
I
told
myself
after
you
were
gone
that
maybe
maybe
the
Cauldron
had
been
kind
and
not
cruel
for
letting
me
see
you
Just
once
A
gift
for
what
I
was
enduring
And
when
you
were
gone
I
found
those
three
picts
I
broke
into
their
minds
reshaping
their
lives
their
histories
and
dragged
them
before
Amarantha
I
made
them
confess
to
conspiring
to
find
other
rebels
that
night
I
made
them
lie
and
claim
that
they
hated
her
I
watched
her
carve
them
up
while
they
were
still
alive
protesting
their
innocence
I
enjoyed
it
because
I
knew
what
they
had
wanted
to
do
to
you
And
knew
that
it
would
have
paled
in
comparison
to
what
Amarantha
would
have
done
if
she’d
found
you
I
wrapped
a
hand
around
my
throat
I
had
my
reasons
to
be
out
then
he’d
once
said
to
me
Under
the
Mountain
Do
not
think
Feyre
that
it
did
not
cost
me
Rhys
kept
staring
at
the
table
as
he
said
I
didn’t
know
That
you
were
with
Tamlin
That
you
were
staying
at
the
Spring
Court
Amarantha
sent
me
that
day
after
the
Summer
Solstice
because
I’d
been
so
successful
on
Calanmai
I
was
prepared
to
mock
him
maybe
pick
a
fight
But
then
I
got
into
that
room
and
the
scent
was
familiar
but
hidden
And
then
I
saw
the
plate
and
felt
the
glamour
and
There
you
were
Living
in
my
second-most
enemy’s
house
Dining
with
him
Reeking
of
his
scent
Looking
at
him
like
Like
you
loved
him
The
whites
of
his
knuckles
showed
And
I
decided
that
I
had
to
scare
Tamlin
I
had
to
scare
you
and
Lucien
but
mostly
Tamlin
Because
I
saw
how
he
looked
at
you
too
So
what
I
did
that
day
His
lips
were
pale
tight
I
broke
into
your
mind
and
held
it
enough
that
you
felt
it
that
it
terrified
you
hurt
you
I
made
Tamlin
beg
as
Amarantha
had
made
me
beg
to
show
him
how
powerless
he
was
to
save
you
And
I
prayed
my
performance
was
enough
to
get
him
to
send
you
away
Back
to
the
human
realm
away
from
Amarantha
Because
she
was
going
to
find
you
If
you
broke
that
curse
she
was
going
to
find
you
and
kill
you
But
I
was
so
selfish
I
was
so
stupidly
selfish
that
I
couldn’t
walk
away
without
knowing
your
name
And
you
were
looking
at
me
like
I
was
a
monster
so
I
told
myself
it
didn’t
matter
anyway
But
you
lied
when
I
asked
I
knew
you
did
I
had
your
mind
in
my
hands
and
you
had
the
defiance
and
foresight
to
lie
to
my
face
So
I
walked
away
from
you
again
I
vomited
my
guts
up
as
soon
as
I
left
My
lips
wobbled
and
I
pressed
them
together
I
checked
back
once
To
ensure
you
were
gone
I
went
with
them
the
day
they
sacked
the
manor
to
make
my
performance
complete
I
told
Amarantha
the
name
of
that
girl
thinking
you’d
invented
it
I
had
no
idea
I
had
no
idea
she’d
send
her
cronies
to
retrieve
Clare
But
if
I
admitted
my
lie
He
swallowed
hard
I
broke
into
Clare’s
head
when
they
brought
her
Under
the
Mountain
I
took
away
her
pain
and
told
her
to
scream
when
expected
to
So
they
they
did
those
things
to
her
and
I
tried
to
make
it
right
but
After
a
week
I
couldn’t
let
them
do
it
Hurt
her
like
that
anymore
So
while
they
tortured
her
I
slipped
into
her
mind
again
and
ended
it
She
didn’t
feel
any
pain
She
felt
none
of
what
they
did
to
her
even
at
the
end
But
But
I
still
see
her
And
my
men
And
the
others
that
I
killed
for
Amarantha
Two
tears
slid
down
his
cheeks
swift
and
cold
He
didn’t
wipe
them
away
as
he
said
I
thought
it
was
done
after
that
With
Clare’s
death
Amarantha
believed
you
were
dead
So
you
were
safe
and
far
away
and
my
people
were
safe
and
Tamlin
had
lost
so
it
was
done
We
were
done
But
then
I
was
in
the
back
of
the
throne
room
that
day
the
Attor
brought
you
in
And
I
have
never
known
such
horror
Feyre
as
I
did
when
I
watched
you
make
that
bargain
Irrational
stupid
terror
I
didn’t
know
you
I
didn’t
even
know
your
name
But
I
thought
of
those
painter’s
hands
the
flowers
I’d
seen
you
create
And
how
she’d
delight
in
breaking
your
fingers
apart
I
had
to
stand
and
watch
as
the
Attor
and
its
cronies
beat
you
I
had
to
watch
the
disgust
and
hatred
on
your
face
as
you
looked
at
me
watched
me
threaten
to
shatter
Lucien’s
mind
And
then
then
I
learned
your
name
Hearing
you
say
it
it
was
like
an
answer
to
a
question
I’d
been
asking
for
five
hundred
years
I
decided
then
and
there
that
I
was
going
to
fight
And
I
would
fight
dirty
and
kill
and
torture
and
manipulate
but
I
was
going
to
fight
If
there
was
a
shot
of
freeing
us
from
Amarantha
you
were
it
I
thought
I
thought
the
Cauldron
had
been
sending
me
these
dreams
to
tell
me
that
you
would
be
the
one
to
save
us
Save
my
people
So
I
watched
your
first
trial
Pretending
always
pretending
to
be
that
person
you
hated
When
you
were
hurt
so
badly
against
the
Wyrm
I
found
my
way
in
with
you
A
way
to
defy
Amarantha
to
spread
the
seeds
of
hope
to
those
who
knew
how
to
read
the
message
and
a
way
to
keep
you
alive
without
seeming
too
suspicious
And
a
way
to
get
back
at
Tamlin
To
use
him
against
Amarantha
yes
but
To
get
back
at
him
for
my
mother
and
sister
and
for
having
you
When
we
made
that
bargain
you
were
so
hateful
that
I
knew
I’d
done
my
job
well
So
we
endured
it
I
made
you
dress
like
that
so
Amarantha
wouldn’t
suspect
and
made
you
drink
the
wine
so
you
would
not
remember
the
nightly
horrors
in
that
mountain
And
that
last
night
when
I
found
you
two
in
the
hall
I
was
jealous
I
was
jealous
of
him
and
pissed
off
that
he’d
used
that
one
shot
of
being
unnoticed
not
to
get
you
out
but
to
be
with
you
and
Amarantha
saw
that
jealousy
She
saw
me
kissing
you
to
hide
the
evidence
but
she
saw
why
For
the
first
time
she
saw
why
So
that
night
after
I
left
you
I
had
to
service
her
She
kept
me
there
longer
than
usual
trying
to
squeeze
the
answers
out
of
me
But
I
gave
her
what
she
wanted
to
hear
that
you
were
nothing
that
you
were
human
garbage
that
I’d
use
and
discard
you
Afterward
I
wanted
to
see
you
One
last
time
Alone
I
thought
about
telling
you
everything
but
who
I’d
become
who
you
thought
I
was
I
didn’t
dare
shatter
that
deception
But
your
final
trial
came
and
When
she
started
torturing
you
something
snapped
in
a
way
I
couldn’t
explain
only
that
seeing
you
bleeding
and
screaming
undid
me
It
broke
me
at
last
And
I
knew
as
I
picked
up
that
knife
to
kill
her
I
knew
right
then
what
you
were
I
knew
that
you
were
my
mate
and
you
were
in
love
with
another
male
and
had
destroyed
yourself
to
save
him
and
that
that
I
didn’t
care
If
you
were
going
to
die
I
was
going
to
die
with
you
I
couldn’t
stop
thinking
it
over
and
over
as
you
screamed
as
I
tried
to
kill
her
you
were
my
mate
my
mate
my
mate
But
then
she
snapped
your
neck
Tears
rolled
down
his
face
And
I
felt
you
die
he
whispered
Tears
were
sliding
down
my
own
cheeks
And
this
beautiful
wonderful
thing
that
had
come
into
my
life
this
gift
from
the
Cauldron
It
was
gone
In
my
desperation
I
clung
to
that
bond
Not
the
bargain
the
bargain
was
nothing
the
bargain
was
like
a
cobweb
But
I
grabbed
that
bond
between
us
and
I
tugged
I
willed
you
to
hold
on
to
stay
with
me
because
if
we
could
get
free
If
we
could
get
free
then
all
seven
of
us
were
there
We
could
bring
you
back
And
I
didn’t
care
if
I
had
to
slice
into
all
of
their
minds
to
do
it
I’d
make
them
save
you
His
hands
were
shaking
You’d
freed
us
with
your
last
breath
and
my
power
I
wrapped
my
power
around
the
bond
The
mating
bond
I
could
feel
you
flickering
there
holding
on
Home
Home
had
been
at
the
end
of
the
bond
I’d
told
the
Bone
Carver
Not
Tamlin
not
the
Spring
Court
but
Rhysand
So
Amarantha
died
and
I
spoke
to
the
High
Lords
mind
to
mind
convincing
them
to
come
forward
to
offer
that
spark
of
power
None
of
them
disagreed
I
think
they
were
too
stunned
to
think
of
saying
no
And
I
again
had
to
watch
as
Tamlin
held
you
Kissed
you
I
wanted
to
go
home
to
Velaris
but
I
had
to
stay
to
make
sure
things
were
set
in
motion
that
you
were
all
right
So
I
waited
as
long
as
I
could
then
I
sent
a
tug
through
the
bond
Then
you
came
to
find
me
I
almost
told
you
then
but
You
were
so
sad
And
tired
And
for
once
you
looked
at
me
like
like
I
was
worth
something
So
I
promised
myself
that
the
next
time
I
saw
you
I’d
free
you
of
the
bargain
Because
I
was
selfish
and
knew
that
if
I
let
go
right
then
he’d
lock
you
up
and
I’d
never
get
to
see
you
again
When
I
went
to
leave
you
I
think
transforming
you
into
Fae
made
the
bond
lock
into
place
permanently
I’d
known
it
existed
but
it
hit
me
then
hit
me
so
strong
that
I
panicked
I
knew
if
I
stayed
a
second
longer
I’d
damn
the
consequences
and
take
you
with
me
And
you’d
hate
me
forever
I
landed
at
the
Night
Court
right
as
Mor
was
waiting
for
me
and
I
was
so
frantic
so
unhinged
that
I
told
her
everything
I
hadn’t
seen
her
in
fifty
years
and
my
first
words
to
her
were
‘She’s
my
mate’
And
for
three
months
for
three
months
I
tried
to
convince
myself
that
you
were
better
off
without
me
I
tried
to
convince
myself
that
everything
I’d
done
had
made
you
hate
me
But
I
felt
you
through
the
bond
through
your
open
mental
shields
I
felt
your
pain
and
sadness
and
loneliness
I
felt
you
struggling
to
escape
the
darkness
of
Amarantha
the
same
way
I
was
I
heard
you
were
going
to
marry
him
and
I
told
myself
you
were
happy
I
should
let
you
be
happy
even
if
it
killed
me
Even
if
you
were
my
mate
you’d
earned
that
happiness
The
day
of
your
wedding
I’d
planned
to
get
rip-roaring
drunk
with
Cassian
who
had
no
idea
why
but
But
then
I
felt
you
again
I
felt
your
panic
and
despair
and
heard
you
beg
someone
anyone
to
save
you
I
lost
it
I
winnowed
to
the
wedding
and
barely
remembered
who
I
was
supposed
to
be
the
part
I
was
supposed
to
play
All
I
could
see
was
you
in
your
stupid
wedding
dress
so
thin
So
so
thin
and
pale
And
I
wanted
to
kill
him
for
it
but
I
had
to
get
you
out
Had
to
call
in
that
bargain
just
once
to
get
you
away
to
see
if
you
were
all
right
Rhys
looked
up
at
me
eyes
desolate
It
killed
me
Feyre
to
send
you
back
To
see
you
waste
away
month
by
month
It
killed
me
to
know
he
was
sharing
your
bed
Not
just
because
you
were
my
mate
but
because
I

He
glanced
down
then
up
at
me
again
I
knew
I
knew
I
was
in
love
with
you
that
moment
I
picked
up
the
knife
to
kill
Amarantha
When
you
finally
came
here
I
decided
I
wouldn’t
tell
you
Any
of
it
I
wouldn’t
let
you
out
of
the
bargain
because
your
hatred
was
better
than
facing
the
two
alternatives
that
you
felt
nothing
for
me
or
that
you
you
might
feel
something
similar
and
if
I
let
myself
love
you
you
would
be
taken
from
me
The
way
my
family
was
the
way
my
friends
were
So
I
didn’t
tell
you
I
watched
as
you
faded
away
Until
that
day
that
day
he
locked
you
up
I
would
have
killed
him
if
he’d
been
there
But
I
broke
some
very
very
fundamental
rules
in
taking
you
away
Amren
said
if
I
got
you
to
admit
that
we
were
mates
it
would
keep
any
trouble
from
our
door
but
I
couldn’t
force
the
bond
on
you
I
couldn’t
try
to
seduce
you
into
accepting
the
bond
either
Even
if
it
gave
Tamlin
license
to
wage
war
on
me
You
had
been
through
so
much
already
I
didn’t
want
you
to
think
that
everything
I
did
was
to
win
you
just
to
keep
my
lands
safe
But
I
couldn’t
I
couldn’t
stop
being
around
you
and
loving
you
and
wanting
you
I
still
can’t
stay
away
He
leaned
back
loosing
a
long
breath
Slowly
I
turned
around
to
where
the
soup
was
now
boiling
and
ladled
it
into
a
bowl
He
watched
every
step
I
took
to
the
table
the
steaming
bowl
in
my
hands
I
stopped
before
him
staring
down
And
I
said
You
love
me
Rhys
nodded
And
I
wondered
if
love
was
too
weak
a
word
for
what
he
felt
what
he’d
done
for
me
For
what
I
felt
for
him
I
set
the
bowl
down
before
him
Then
eat
